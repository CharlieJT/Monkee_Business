# HELLO AND WELCOME TO THE MONKEES!


## THIS PROJECT WILL BE FOUND UNDER THE NAME 'MONKEE_PAGES'

These pages are part of an online campaign by the world famous band "The Monkees" to reach a wider audience
and showcase some of their history in the tv and music industry.
The site is made up of 4 pages, a landing/home page, a page with images of the band and some of their albums, a contact
page to allow users to either send a message and or enquire about booking the band for their own event and finally an offer
of some audio links and a video link embeddded behind some more pictures from the band.

## UX PROCESS

Whilst designing a site for the band I took time to consider who will be the main users of these pages,
looking at the history of the band I think it would be fair to say that we are dealing with a more senior
market profile but equally not forgetting that they also wish to reach out to a new audience through this platform.

During the wireframe process I was keen to keep the pages quite simple in layout along with clearly defined movement
options and messaging.  This was driven by the high potential of less familiar users of websites who may be more akin
to record sleeves and imagery.
To this extent I looked at the visual history of the Monkees and found that a great deal of colour was used and with very
striking content and structure, a very much reflection of the era in which they were born/incepted ie the 60's

I have reflected this on my pages by using these bold colours along with 2 types of font that were also prevalent during this
era; Righteous and Chicle.

Page One/Home;  We first introduce the band with a black and white image of the boys followed by the navigation buttons.  
The middle of the page gives a short bio of the band then to the right I use this as an opportunity to sell on possible ideas 
for how the user can get involved with the Monkees.
Each nav button is bold and bright and I wanted to show the user when they where on the button with a clear hover animation.
The footer contains clear and bold links to social media and also an opportunity to introduce the bands new album.

This layout theme continues across all 4 pages with a constant header design and layout giving the user a clear and simple 
navigation and by using the logo image as a link back to the home page.

Page two/Photos; A simple collection of images of the band and some of their album sleeves to give the user a visual insight into the
band history.

Page three/Contact; This simple and clear layout will allow user interaction with the band by either sending a message and or booking
request.  I also again reinforce the links to social media as requested by the clients.

Page four/Music;  An opportunity for the user to have a listen to a selection of the bands music, and watch a video of them performing.

Future development of this site would see the use of imagery on the mp3 links and also have a remote player pop up rather than take the 
user off the page and then have to click back to return.
I would also use the home page new album as a link to a sample of the tracks on the album and with a more devisive CTA button to purchase.

## TECH USED
The build of this site used Google Fonts - https://fonts.google.com/
Google offers an easy and free method to embedding performance-optimized web fonts on the site.

Bootstrap - https://getbootstrap.com/
A huge number of resources which is also responsive and mobile first which helps with page builds.

Cloudflare - https://cdnjs.com/
A great source for a huge number of tools to help with the development of your project.

Font Awesome - https://www.bootstrapcdn.com/fontawesome/
Working alongside bootstrapcdn fontawesome is a great resource for icons and animations.

## TESTING

The site was built on a page by page basis with each feature tested as constructed, for example on the home page I set the buttons up and assigned their href and then 
tested the link was directing corrcetly as each page was constructed.
Equally with the contact page I had a couple of issues with layout and getting the correct code to run when and incorrect email address format was submitted.

The last challenge and still an opportunity for develoment was the href to the music and video file location, the initial isues were with the original file location not being
a direct file ie I was using a sub file...
As I mentioned earlier I would like to develop an image into the mp4 player and have it 'pop' into a window rather than switch to a new page.
